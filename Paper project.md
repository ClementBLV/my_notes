plan : 
- presentation de ce qui a été fait durant le stage, très succin reprendre le doc existant 
	- le goal blabla 
- the issues which are not paper oriented 
	- To reduce the computation time for the reconstruction of the knowledge base we were forced to implement some heuristics and a similarity method. But those choices just respond to programming issues, those elements are not suited for a research paper. The project should focus on the positioning of the node inside the branch. Hence, the project could be considered as a problem of node insertion. 
- how to correct those issues 
	- In the experiments we have already done, we have seen the potential of an Entailement task to predict the links between nodes based on their context. This should be where we should direct the future work. We could tackle this issue  : 
	- How node insertion can be reduced to an entitlement task using LLM and how does it perform compared to existing methods? 
	- Focus on the process of correctly placing a node inside a branch, or see if the link created is correct. It presents the advantage of being easily measurable as we can check the triplet ( head - mode inserted - tail), and if we only focus on one relation it reduces to checking the capacity to link two nodes correctly. 
- What to add : 
	- poincarré embedding: Graph embedding - available with code
	- GNN (with OOKB approach) 
	- GCN (should be better than GNN)
	- Sciamese network? (paper isn't free)
	- Entailment (what has already been done)
	- Multitask entailment (several models? + see if there are some transfer learning between the two nodes )
