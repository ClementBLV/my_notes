## Goal 

Build an Italian KB using a monolingual Italian dictionary, an English Italian dictionary and an English KB [[WordNet]] 

## Method 

NB : In wordnet the correspondence among lexical forms (synsets) and meanings (gloss) is maintained through a bi-dimensional 2 matrix in which each synset is understood to be an unambiguous designator of the meaning of the word.

The project foresees a multi-lingual lexical matrix (MLLM) as an extension of the bidimensional lexical matrix implemented in WordNet. A third dimension will be added to the matrix, through which it will be possible to consider different languages.

## Conclusion 

Even if the project is a little bit outdated it is interesting to see how they represent wordnet as a matrix
