Friday Achievement 
- correct a bug (their were still synsets present several time in the list to remove) -> DONE 
- install all the vs code plugins -> DONE
- continue the speed test (cause with the correction of point 1 the time has really increased again )  -> DONE 
- continue the investigation on the relation extraction process (while the test of point 3 are running) -> DONE

Monday 
- finish the speed correction according to the speed results cf txt join, we can see the speed (average of 10 runs) according to different downgrade ratio with two hypothesis, one only using sets and the other using a mixt of list and set so the winner is the combo between list and set (i think the .extend of a list is more efficient than .update of a set ) -> 30 min 
- Write a document with the ranking metric I want to use (I have customize the metric of Automatically constructing Wordnet synsets (the one with the wordnet in different languages)) and examples -> 1h 
- Think more deeply on how to construct the relation between words by using the definition -> 3h30    (I have ideas but it is still too unclear in my head to write it clearly as a bullet point here ahah   )
