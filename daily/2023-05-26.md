Thursday Achievement 
- It is was to long to compute all the similarity of between the synset candidate from the rich base and the all the synset from the weak one. Instead we should use the fact that we already have an ordered information on both sides, and find the closest common element between the two KG, eg for from imagine in the rich kg we have rannid -- frog -- amphibian -- vertebrate, and in the weak one we have  reptile -- vertebrate then we should only look at the synset going from the closest common ancestor here vertebrate . If it is not clear a can make a sketch
- Redesign the test of similarity with this hypothesis -> In Progress
- Continue the entailment implementation -> DONE the implementation of a process to test the entailement task of either hypernym or hyponym -> lunch the test right now 

Friday Goal : 
- Implement the "move forward" similarity, eg it move along a branch in order to maximize the similarity , from the lowest common synset, it get all the hyponyms of 1 rst order and the one of second order and move in the direction where the similarity score between those synsets and the candidate synset is the higest (maybe test with 3 order as well) ->2h 
- implement a test method to evaluate that, (se it it got the correct path or not )
- continue to run the test on the entailment
