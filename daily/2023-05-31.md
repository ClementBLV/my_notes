  Thursday Goal 
- Obtain the similarity value of totally unlinked synsets, to do so  we compute the similarity sur 1000 random and we test their similarity on 1000 other random synsets 
- Se the average number of hopes after which the similarity becomes irrelevant, eg when the similarity is the same as the random value 
- Add a parameter for context net into the hop function which look for the score of several layers at a time 
- Make some research about bootstrap 

- adapter le cotext lenght en parametre 


Friday Goal :
- See for a random hyponym in how much hops it rich a ceiling 
- See for a random hyponym, with a random march on the branch in how many hops we are at a leaf 
- Depending of the previous values adapt the code to have a variable hyponym depth 
- make a small investigation on bootstrap 
- Re-oder the notes 
	- pour avoir le temps de calcul en fonction de la context lenght
	- avoir le temps de computation
