Wedneday Achievement  
- Finish the test of the semantic analysis -> Still running it is way too long to check each sentence for similarity but I had an idea = explained in todays goal 
- Load an entailment model and test how its work with the definitions of the n closest synsets from the step before  -> DONE seems fine BUT its doesn't seem to get the order of the relation (frog is a type of rannid entail but rannid is a type of frog also entail)

Thursday Goal 
- It is was to long to compute all the similarity of between the synset candidate from the rich base and the all the synset from the weak one. Instead we should use the fact that we already have an ordered information on both sides, and find the closest common element between the two KG, eg for from imagine in the rich kg we have rannid -- frog -- amphibian -- vertebrate, and in the weak one we have  reptile -- vertebrate then we should only look at the synset going from the closest common ancestor here vertebrate . If it is not clear a can make a sketch
- Redesign the test of similarity with this hypothesis 
- Continue the entailment implementation
