Wednesday Achievement 
- transform the code to get a list of candidate synset to remove. From the original code I have split it into to child classes. A Cut class which gives a list of synset to removes composed of all the branch. And a snipper class which gives a list of only synset to removes (not the branch) and a json of relation to link together (eg link Removed synset hyponyms to removed synset hypernyms)

Thursday Goal 
- Change the XML  parcer in order to take into account the Relation.json file to change the relations 

Friday Goal :
- Evaluate every thinks works correctly and make some tests
