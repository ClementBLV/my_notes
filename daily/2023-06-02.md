Friday Achievement 
 - Depending of the previous values adapt the code to have a variable hyponym depth -> Just finished its vas a little bit longer but the code is nice 

Monday Goal 
- The previous code is in a class which can compute a path base on the number of hyponyms we ask to look at it is currently in my sandbox Jupiter I gonna put it in a .py to be able to use it from anywhere. And I gonna test the model cause there will probably have some import issues and variables issues
- make a small investigation on bootstrap 
- Think on how to test the performances and time consumption
- Reoder the sand box experiments Jupiter and push it 
- 



- Re-oder the notes 
	- pour avoir le temps de calcul en fonction de la context lenght
	- avoir le temps de computation
