Friday Achievement : 
- Implement the "move forward" similarity, eg it move along a branch in order to maximize the similarity , from the lowest common synset, it get all the hyponyms of 1 rst order and the one of second order and move in the direction where the similarity score between those synsets and the candidate synset is the higest (maybe test with 3 order as well) ->DONE
- implement a test method to evaluate that, (se it it got the correct path or not ) -> DONE
- continue to run the test on the entailment 
- [+]  i have created a class to generate clean test dataset to clearly evaluate the similarity performance. The set look like that : 
	- { True : the true path on the branch , False a random path } = goal is to see if the most similar one is the True path which mean the path on which the candidate synset belongs 
	- { True : the true path on the branch , False : a path stating with the same origin as the true but with a random bifurcation at the first order   } ex :  Candidate : Salamander ,   True : vertebrate - amphibian - mud salamander  , False : vertebrate - reptiles - lizard - tropical lizard 
	- { True : the true path on the branch , False : a path stating with the same origin as the true but with a random bifurcation at the second order   } ex :  Candidate : Salamander ,   True : vertebrate - amphibian - mud salamander  , False : vertebrate - amphibian - frog - true frog ...


Monday Goal 
- check all the call to generate dataset cause i did it on Friday before leaving so there might be errors 
- Clean all the test jupyter cause its messy, and write clean test with the new class 
	- for entailment -> do with more examples 
	- for similarity lunch the tests on the 3 points i have told before, with the old similarity model and a new one which i think is better
